### **Ideas for Future Development**

As of now, Auto-Score can only score keep for volleyball, but future generations of this device may automate scorekeeping for other sports. In a permanent and more professional volleyball court, this device should be mounted from the ceiling, propped next to a wall, or rise out of the floor, instead of freestanding, to save space and prevent it from being knocked over. The camera can also be replaced with a more high-definition camera for better quality and more accurate image processing (Refer to Note). Machine learning can also be used to erase the need for having to set parameters for detecting points and the need for the second program (refer to Design for details). Due to the terms of services of many companies’ scoreboards, this machine was not tested on a full-scale scoreboard. However, future generations of Auto-Score will likely include and operate on a regular-sized scoreboard, since that was the original plan for this machine. To sum up, even though almost every component used in this prototype has a faster and more durable alternative, this prototype shows demonstrates the bare minimum required to bring this concept to life. 



*Note:* This project is using the lowest resolution for the camera as the computer running the program is too slow to handle other settings.
