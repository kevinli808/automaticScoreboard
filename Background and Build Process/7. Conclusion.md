### **Conclusion** 

&nbsp;	Although Auto-Score is only a prototype at the moment, it paves a path and shows a glimpse into the future of automation. This device provides lower levels of volleyball, such as schools, an affordable and accurate alternative way of scorekeeping. However, new policies for scorekeeping in non-professional environments may come into play soon, which may solve the problems that this machine sets out to fix. From the author’s understanding, student scorekeepers for high school volleyball games are paid from nothing to twenty dollars per game, which averages around ninety minutes (FIVB, 2016). Ninety minutes is a long time for many teenagers to stay focused on one task and with a small salary, there is little reason for student scorekeepers to stay motivated and attentive to the game, which can lead to mistakes. Until this issue can be resolved, scorekeeper mistakes will continue to plague the lower, non-professional side of volleyball, which can push young and upcoming individuals away from this sport. This machine sets out to ensure that all individuals, especially students, do not lose interest in volleyball because of errors in scorekeeping. To conclude, although it will not make it into professional play anytime soon, perhaps one day, Auto-Score will find its way into the ceilings of high school gyms and the walls of local volleyball courts, pushing towards a future of automation and errorless scorekeeping.
