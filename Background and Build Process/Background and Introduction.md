### **Background and Introduction** 

&nbsp;	Volleyball is a sport played by two teams of six on an eighteen by nine meter court. The purpose of the game is to make the ball hit the ground on the opponent’s side whilst keeping it in the air on one’s side. The beginning of a round always starts with a serve by the team that won the previous round. If it is the beginning of the game, then the first serve is decided by a coin flip. Rounds are grouped by sets, which are won when one team wins twenty-five rounds, and the other team is at least two points behind. If the other team is less than two points behind, both teams keep playing past twenty-five points until one team gains a two-point lead. After one team wins a set, there is a three-minute break before the next set. Sets are played as a best out of three or five, depending on the category the players belong to (FIVB, 2016).

&nbsp;	Both teams can call for a one-minute timeout, twice per set, when the ball is not in play (FIVB, 2016).

&nbsp;	Like in most sports, volleyball referees use a variety of hand gestures to communicate events that happen in-game (WoV, 2016). This project will focus on the hand gesture that signals that a point has been scored and the hand gesture that signals that a team is allowed to serve. These two gestures are the only two that require the referee to fully extend one of their arms parallel to the ground, with the only difference between the two being the motion the referee does after they extend their arm. However, from the back, it is nearly impossible to tell which gesture the referee is signalling without looking at the game.

&nbsp;	Scoreboards in volleyball can display all types of information, from highlights to the period number, and are used to communicate important information about the current match to the audience and referees. This project will be automating the standard scoreboard seen across modern-day schools and volleyball courts. This type of scoreboard displays the following information: a timer, the home and guest scores, the current period number and the number of sets won by home and guest sides. 

&nbsp;	Auto-Score will be the first automatic scoreboard for any sport, with the only other attempt at this concept being a score-counter built for basketball with a much simpler design, consisting of an ultrasonic sensor and a Raspberry Pi. The device is unable to display any other aspects of the game, apart from the score, that a standard basketball scoreboard would normally showcase, meaning that it does not qualify as a scoreboard (Catanzariti, 2019). Even its creator, Catanzariti, admits in a Twitter message that he “probably wouldn't count on the ultrasonic sensor for anything professional – \[individuals would] want something very precise for pro basketball” (direct message, January 30, 2022).
