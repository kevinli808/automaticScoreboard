**Auto-Score: The Future of Scorekeeping**
Scoreboards are an essential aspect of volleyball-providing audiences with information and helping referees make calls-until they display the wrong information. Games at lower levels are plagued by scoreboard-related issues, as many scorekeepers are undertrained and unmotivated to perform their job correctly.

This project, Auto-Score, addresses these issues through the use of a semi-automatic scoreboard; a machine that eliminates the need for human scorekeepers. Made with commonly found parts, this device is programmed in C++ and Python, allowing for accurate point detection and the ability to recognize and respond to in-game volleyball events. It is able to display all the information that a standard volleyball scoreboard presents, without the need for an operator.

Auto-Score aims to provide an affordable and accurate alternative to scorekeeping for lower levels of volleyball, marking the beginning of an automated and errorless future for scorekeeping.
